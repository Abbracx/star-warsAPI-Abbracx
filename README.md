# A STARWARS SPA

## Problem Description:

Create a SPA (single page application) using html, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people).

### Process ?

1. Display a dummy image for all single characters

2. Make a HTTP request to populate your frontend application using the API
 - Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.
 - On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only.

3. All implementations should be done using es6.

4. Make your design pretty and responsive.

5. When you are done, host on heroku or netlify (link should be added to your turned in field on Teams)
